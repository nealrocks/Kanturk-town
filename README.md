# Kanturk Town Website

The core purpose of this website is to provide core information about Kanturk. This information will be most useful to individuals that have recently relocated to Kanturk Town. Indeed, it is also useful information to anyone who is thinking of moving to the town. This website provides them with a historical overview of its landmark castle which is situated on the entrance of the town. Additionally, this website provides the user with information about social activities in the form of clubs and groups for both adults and children alike. The key benefit of this information is that it will support newcomers to make decisions on what they would like to do and ultimately, it will assist them to meet locals and become emeshed in their local community. 

# UX

### **User Goals:**
* A website that gives a brief history about the castle in the town.
* A website that provides pertinent information on the variety of local clubs and groups.
* A website that gives the information on the future development of the town, for instance, the new school building, etc.,
* The wesite is easy to use regardless of what device is being used e.g., laptops, tablets or mobile devices.

### **Site Owner Goals:**
* Raise the profile of Kanturk town.
* Persuade the user to contact the clubs or groups in the town by encouraging them to go to their website
 and/or Facebook page.

### **Website Features:**

**Welcome Page Feature:**

* My website homepage I went with a photo of a sign saying "Welcome to Kanturk" in Irish and I have Kanturk
  Town as my Heading and I had the headings of my other Three pages on the left-side at the top of the page. 

**History Page:**

* My Second page is my History page and I went with a photo of Kanturk castle with a brief story about the
  castle to go with the photo.

**Clubs & Groups Page:**

* My Third page is my Clubs & Groups page with all the clubs & groups in Kanturk town with a link attached to
  each of them so it will lead the user to their webpage or facebook page. 

**Future Page:**
<img src="images/Kanturk-website-future.JPG">

* My Fourth page is my future page with everything that is going to be built in Kanturk town in the very near future and links attached to them so they can read about them.

### **Colour Scheme:**
The theme I went with was a red colour for my main heading (h1) as 'red' attracts attention and helps the website 'stand out from he crowd. I settled on blue for my (h2) headings in my "Clubs & Groups" page and my "Future" page because it is thought that blue typically evoke emotions of professionalism, authority, and trust.

### **Font:** 
* Oswald and [Sans Serif](https://fonts.google.com/?category=Sans+Serif) were used in the main header 
  throughout the four pages.


# Features

The features of this website can be broken into groups, namely, existing 
features and features that will be implemented in the future. 

### **Potential Features:**
* A video attached to the Clubs & Groups page with people being interviewed about the clubs and groups that they have joined. This video montage will also feature how the contribute to the town.It it also include a 'call to action' with an inspiring appeal for new members to join.


### **Existing Features:**
* Headings in the menu bar when clicked on will lead you to that page.
* Links created in Clubs & Groups that when clicked on would lead you to their webpage or facebook page. 
* Responsive on all device sizes when I added @media to my css file.

### **Features Left to Implement:**
Future ideas to be implemented are:
* Imagery to become more implemented in future projects with possible audio visuals attached.

### **Languages Used:**
* [html5](https://www.techradar.com/news/internet/web/html5-what-is-it-1047393)
* [CSS3](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/css/css3_tutorial.htm)

### **Frameworks, Libraries and Programs Used:**
1. [Dev Tools:](https://dev.tools.com/)
> Google fonts were used to import the oswald , sans-serif font into the style.css file which is used on all 
pages throughout the project
2. [Font Awesome:](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&m=free)
> This was use to select and use icons for my website.
3. [Github:] (https://github.com/)
> Git and Github were both used for version control.

# Testing

* The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project. There were a number of errors which perplexed me but I'm confident that the more experienced I become via this course the more likely it is that I will be able to troubleshoot and rectify these errors. 

### **Further Testing:**
The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers by using a specific tester called 
[Responsive Design](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/).

* The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop and  Mobile.
* A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
* Friends and family members were asked to review the site and document the exact point where they noticed 
something didnâ€™t look right or didn't work.  

### **Known Bugs:**
* Not to use "viewport" in the <meta name> as it would prevent users from resizing documents.
